        <h4>More info about this coffee:</h4>
        <p>This coffee is harvested at precise ripeness by an experienced team of 15 long-time Finca San José coffee
          pickers who have worked with Arnold Paz for over 20 years. For this particular lot of Gesha, it is soaked in
          water for 24 hours to clean the cherries and limit the bacteria present during drying. The coffee is then
          dried on a clean patio for 8 hours before arriving into raised beds inside a domed greenhouse, where the
          coffee then slowly dries for 30 days. After this drying process is complete and the coffee reaches a humidity
          of 11%, it is all stored together in a large oak crate to rest and homogenize for another 30 days before being
          ready for export. This attention to detail produces a beautiful fruity coffee with elegant floral notes, berry
          flavors and a refreshing citric acidity.</p>
        <h4>More info about this farm:</h4>
        <p>The Paz-Mejía family has been growing coffee for more than 140 years in the region of Santa Bárbara,
          Honduras. Arnold's father, Jose A. Paz Sr. started the process of specializing in high quality coffee and
          Arnold has taken it to new levels, applying his background as an agronomist to make Finca San Jose an example
          of the highest quality, sustainable coffee farms in the world. Arnold is also running a nursery of several
          different varietals, in order to support coffee growers nationwide and secure the genetic diversity that is
          necessary for coffee to survive the effects of disease and climate change.</p>
