        <h4>More info about this coffee:</h4>
        <p>This coffee is one of Don Orlando's latest experiments with anaerobic fermentation. Usually, coffee cherry is
          processed within hours of picking to avoid excessive aerobic fermentation that can render the coffee sour or
          too “funky.” In Don Orlando’s anaerobic process, he locks the cherry in a water filled drum, monitors the PH
          and temperature to ensure slow anaerobic fermentation that metabolizes the fruit sugars without leaving a
          vinegar taste, heightening the flavor qualities of the coffee while producing a rich body. After about 72
          hours, he washes the cherry, then spreads them out to dry on raised screens for 20-25 days. The care given to
          these beans by Don Orlando and his family is second to none, as is the unique experience of enjoying a cup.
        </p>
        <h4>More info about this farm:</h4>
        <p>Don Orlando started Finca Jireh close to 30 years ago and since has been a pioneer in specialty coffees in
          Honduras. He has participated and won the cup of excellence in the past and continues to win accolades for his
          coffees year after year. Don Orlando’s focus on quality is easily appreciated by a look at his farm and his
          constant experimentation with various processing methods. He is also one of the first Honduran farmers to have
          a zero waste farm, where any waste produced by coffee growing is recycled in some way and reused to add value.
          He recycles all the water from his wet mill and ensures it returns without any particles, the Cascara (cherry
          fruit) is either composted for organic fertilizer or carefully washed and dried for tea.</p>
