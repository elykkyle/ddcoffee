      <h4>More info about this coffee:</h4>
      <p>Tiny Footprint Coffee is excited to bring you this exclusive offering - the Maragogype bean from Finca La
        Guadalupe. The Maragogype is known as "elephant bean" because of itâ€™s larger size, and in our opinion, its
        refined elegance. A mutation of the Typica varietal, this Maragogype coffee from Seline Recinos comes with a
        round body, great clarity and flavors of rich chocolate with different stone fruit notes dancing in and out.</p>
      <h4>More info about this farm:</h4>
      <p>Over 40 years ago, Selin Recinos Sr. and Petrona Perez started Finca La Guadalupe as a small plot of land,
        hoping it would help their family prosper. With a keen eye on sustainability, slowly but surely, through two
        generations of hard work and dedication, the small plot they started has grown. Beyond just growing quality
        coffee, Selin Jr. demonstrates a strong commitment to growing coffee sustainably, building on the bedrock laid
        by his father. He minimizes water use alongside a water recycling system, protects the wildlife on his farms,
        and continues to plant trees on his land. What results from this passion is a sustainable farm and coffee of
        beyond exceptional quality.</p>
