I created this site to serve as a reference for a gift I gave to a friend.  
I wanted him to have a centralized and easy to navigate source of information about the various coffees included in the present.  
QR codes w/ URLs to the specific roasts were printed on stickers and affixed to the respective coffee bags.  
(I originally wanted to use NFC tags, but the coffee bags were lined with aluminum foil which interfered with the NFC tags.)
