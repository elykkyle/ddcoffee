# ddcoffee
I created this site to serve as a reference for a gift I gave to a friend.
I wanted him to have a centralized and easy to navigate source of information about the various coffees included in the present.
I threw this site together and printed QR codes of the URLs for the different coffee varieties on stickers and applied the stickers to the bags of coffee.
(I originally wanted to use NFC tags, but the coffee bags were lined with aluminum foil which interfered with the NFC tags.)
